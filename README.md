I just like writing code. I'm fluent in python, and am currently trying to extend my horizons to other languages such as Rust and C, as well as libraries within python for web-scraping, AI/ML, Cloud computing etc. Basically, I'm trying to broaden my tech stack.

> Click [here](https://github.com/tathyagarg/tathyagarg/blob/main/tech_stack.md) to see the frameworks I'm learning.

## Langauges
In terms of coding languages, I mainly code in Python, but am well-versed in C and am learning Assembly.
In terms of real-world languages, I'm fluent in English and speak decent German. I'm also learning Dutch.

## Tech Stack
Currently working on this right now, but I'm fluent in Python, and I'm learning Rust, C and frameworks in Python to use in the real world. Might also learn C++ along with frameworks for their real world application (Game design?)

## Projects:
1. [Discontinued] [TathyaLang](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TathyaLang) - My custom programming language written in Rust (everyone needs their own language, right?)
2. [TathyLang-python](https://github.com/TathyaLang/TathyaLang-python) - The same programming language but written in Python (I'm more fliuent in Python than in Rust)
3. [Minimal Menu Maker](https://github.com/tathyagarg/min-menu-maker) - A minimal menu maker to make choice menus in python. You can create a whole menu in 1 line.
4. [Discontinued] [TathyaOS](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TutorialOS) - My own OS written in Rust. Discontinued as I didn't want to blindly follow a tutorial. Might make another OS soon though.
5. [Chatbot](https://github.com/tathyagarg/chatbot) - Trying to learn data science and AI, thought this would be a good way to do so.

## Future Projects
1.~~A personal portfolio website~~\
2.~~A blog~~\
3. Also I have a few data science projects lined up to work on.\

Also, a sub-directory, `tathyagarg/tathyagarg/mini_projects`, contains small mini projects that are too quick and small for a dedicated repo, but I still would like to show.

## Currently Learning
Currently learning Quantum Computing! It's so interesting but so confusing haha. Check out my progress [here](https://github.com/tathyagarg/quantum_computing)/\
Also currently learning Machine Learning through [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) (starting soon).
