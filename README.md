I just like writing code. I'm fluent in python, and am currently trying to extend my horizons to other languages such as Rust and C, as well as libraries within python for web-scraping, AI/ML, Cloud computing etc. Basically, I'm trying to broaden my tech stack.

> Click [here](https://github.com/tathyagarg/tathyagarg/blob/main/tech_stack.md) to see the frameworks I'm learning.

## Tech Stack
Currently working on this right now, but I'm fluent in Python, but I'm learning Rust, C and frameworks in Python to use it in real world. Might also learn C++ along with frameworks for its real world application (Game design?)

## Projects:
1. [Discontinued] [TathyaLang](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TathyaLang) - My custom programming language written in Rust (everyone needs their own language, right?)
2. [TathyLang-python](https://github.com/TathyaLang/TathyaLang-python) - The same programming language but written in Python (I'm more fliuent in Python than in Rust)
3. [Minimal Menu Maker](https://github.com/tathyagarg/min-menu-maker) - A minimal menu maker to make choice menus in python. You can create a whole menu in 1 line.
4. [TathyaOS](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TutorialOS) - My own OS written in Rust. Discontinued as I didn't want to blindly follow a tutorial. Might make another OS soon though.

Also, this directory, `tathyagarg/tathyagarg`, contains random code files that don't really require a repository but I still want to show.

## Currently Learning
I'm currently learning Machine Learning through [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).
Also learning assembly programming so I can make my own OS in the future.
