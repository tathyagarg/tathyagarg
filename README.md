# Hi, I'm Tathya

Recently started using GitHub again, don't feel like making a whole file about me.

Projects:
1. [Discontinued] [TathyaLang](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TathyaLang) - My custom programming language written in Rust (everyone needs their own language, right?)
2. [TathyLang-python](https://github.com/TathyaLang/TathyaLang-python) - The same programming language but written in Python (I'm more fliuent in Python than in Rust)
3. [Minimal Menu Maker](https://github.com/tathyagarg/min-menu-maker) - A minimal menu maker to make choice menus in python. You can create a whole menu in 1 line.
