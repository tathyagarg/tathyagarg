# Hi, I'm Tathya

Recently started using GitHub again, don't feel like making a whole file about me.

Projects:
1. [TathyaLang](https://github.com/tathyagarg/TathyaLang) - My custom programming language written in Rust (everyone needs their own language, right?)
2. [Minimal Menu Maker](https://github.com/tathyagarg/min-menu-maker) - A minimal menu maker to make choice menus in python. You can create a whole menu in 1 line.
